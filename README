dmenu-pango-imlib - dynamic menu (with pango && imlib)
====================
Pango and imlib patched dmenu.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu-pango-imlib you need the Xlib, pango and imlib header/library files


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for details.

Thumbnails get cached to $XDG_DATA_HOME/dmenu/imlib.

Pass -g to generate thumbnails immediatly for the piped images.
Pass -is to specify image size (keeping aspect ratio).
Note, that using too big images cause slowdown because images are loaded each time, selection image differs from last image.

Example pipe listing with images:
IMG:/mnt/pictures/lolcat.jpg\tThis is a lolcat\n
IMG:/mnt/pictures/david.jpg\tThis is a picture of david\n
This is a item without a picture\n

Additional options:
Pass -si to specify starting index to dmenu.
ex. -si 5 to start from item 5.
